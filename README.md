## 👋 About Me

I am a **student developer with a strong focus on server systems, networking, and embedded IoT**, driven by hands-on learning and real-world experimentation.

I enjoy building and managing complete systems by myself — from hardware and firmware to servers, services, and automation.  
My approach is practical: I learn by deploying, breaking, fixing, and improving real systems.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Do

- 🖥 Build and manage **Linux servers**
- 🌐 Work with **networking, IP systems, and service connectivity**
- ⚙️ Develop **embedded firmware** for ESP8266 / ESP32
- 📡 Integrate **IoT devices with servers and services**
- 🔧 Automate monitoring, reporting, and notifications
- 🧪 Experiment with system performance, reliability, and stability

I am comfortable handling both **hardware and software layers** of a system.
