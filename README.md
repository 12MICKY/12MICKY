## 👋 About Me

I am a **student developer focused on server systems, networking, and IoT**, with a strong emphasis on hands-on learning and real-world system building.

I enjoy working across multiple layers of technology — from embedded hardware and firmware to servers, networking, monitoring, and automation.  
My approach is practical: I build real systems, deploy them, observe issues, and continuously improve stability and reliability.
