## 👋 About Me

I am a **student developer focused on server systems, networking, and IoT**, with a strong emphasis on hands-on learning and real-world system building.

I enjoy working across the entire technology stack — from embedded hardware and firmware to servers, networking, monitoring, and automation.  
My approach is practical: I build real systems, deploy them, observe failures, fix issues, and continuously improve reliability and performance.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Do

- 🖥 Build and manage **Linux-based servers**
- 🌐 Work with **network systems, IP connectivity, and service communication**
- ⚙️ Develop **embedded firmware** for ESP8266 / ESP32
- 📡 Integrate **IoT devices with servers and automation systems**
- 🔔 Create **monitoring, alerting, and reporting tools**
- 🧪 Experiment with system performance, uptime, and stability

I am comfortable handling **end-to-end systems independently**, from hardware to infrastructure.
